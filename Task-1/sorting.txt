Task - 1 - Pseudocode for sort 10GB of integer data with 1GB of RAM.

The solution is : External Sorting

All the integer data can not be sorted at once as the data size is much larger than the size of the memory.
So the idea is to devide the entire array into chunks of much smaller size that can be easily supported by RAM size.
now sort the individual chunks and then merge them into one single output.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 - Read input file in chunks such that at most 'available RAM size' elements are read at a time.

2 - Sort the chunk using any sorting methods such as quick-sort or merge-sort.

3 - Write the sorted array in a file.

3 - Repeat the above 3 steps until EOF and all the integer elements are sorted and stored on disk.

4 - Load the sorted files one by one as needed and Merge them using the "merge k sorted arrays"
